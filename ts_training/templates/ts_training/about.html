		<h3>Why does this exist?</h2>
		<p>York Technical Theatre Society training records have been stored in various different paper systems for as many years as the theatre has had training. This website provides a way to search through that, browse  easily, and be more accessible than a binder of paper in the tech box or workshop.</p>
		<p>Whether you're an experienced techie, a seasoned pro with a drill, a director, brand new to the Society, or anything in between, this website will hopefully give you a better idea of how tech in the society works, and serve as a reminder for anything you've forgotten.</p>

		<h3>What's so good about training?</h2>
		<p>Being trained in something gives everyone - fellow backstage people, as well as directors, producers, and so on - something to see how you're getting on. If you're looking to become a lighting designer, or want to get involved with the designing and construction of set, having the training ticked off is a sure fire way to let everyone know you know your stuff.</p>
		<p>We try to make training as fun and practical as we can so that everyone involved enjoys themselves as much as we enjoy doing the shows themselves. (Or at least almost that much.)</p>

		<h3>Want to be trained in something?</h2>
		<p>Just ask! The Equipment and Training Manager os happy to explain pretty much any area of tech to anyone who asks, provided we're not already up a ladder with five minutes until the show opens!</p>

	<div class="col-12 col-sm-6">
		<h3>Has your training record got gaps?</h2>
		<p>Just speak to the Internal Vice Chair or Equipment and Training Manager about the areas of tech you think you should be signed off on. They'll ask you a few questions to check you know your stuff - fairly informally, don't worry - and fill in any gaps for you. The relevant committee members will happily go through training records with people, just ask.</p>
